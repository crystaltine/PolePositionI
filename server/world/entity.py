    Represents a car. (for now, can generalize later).
    Has pos, vel, acc, angle, and a circular hitbox with a certain radius.
    
    ### This must effectively be the same as on the client side
    ^ just with a few extra things maybe, since we have to deal with client objects
    
    Implements a few testing functions that randomize movement
    
    angle is just the dir in which they are facing right now, not the angle of any physics vector. Its mostly cosmetic.
    
    ### IMPORANT ANGLE INFO:
    0 is rightward (+x), 90 is upward (+y), 180 is leftward (-x), 270 is downward (-y)
    
    Thus, turning left would be increasing the angle, and turning right would be decreasing the angle.
